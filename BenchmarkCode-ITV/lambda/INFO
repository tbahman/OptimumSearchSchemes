Description: Lambda is a biological sequence aligner optimized for many
query sequences and searches in protein space. It is highly compatible
to BLAST (bitscore and e-value statistics, tab seperated and verbose
output formats), much faster than BLAST and many other comparable tools
and supports many other input and output formats, including standards-
conformant .sam and .bam and many compression types
